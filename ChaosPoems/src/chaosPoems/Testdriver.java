As Zarif met the EU's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, and prepared to shake the hands of the US secretary of state, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/john-kerry\">John Kerry</a>, hardliners in Tehran made clear they were still opposed to the United States and feared any prospect of an agreement in Geneva. [...]</p> <p>The leader of Tehran's Friday prayers, Ayatollah Ali Movahedi Kermani, said in remarks broadcast live on national radio that any deal with the west would be detrimental to Iran. &quot;It's harmful to underestimate the enemy because they do nothing but play tricks,&quot; Kermani said. &quot;Our enemy would not rest even for a moment. If we underestimate the enemy, we will definitely get hurt.&quot; [...]</p> <p>Despite Kermani's warning, Rouhani's diplomacy appears to have the support of Khamenei, who has ultimate power in all state matters. Khamenei has criticised those who labelled Iran's nuclear negotiators &quot;compromisers&quot;, warning that they had a difficult mission and no one should &quot;weaken an official who is busy with work&quot;.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/08/iran-nuclear-talks-diplomatic-progress-geneva-hardliners\">full piece here</a>.&nbsp;</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527d57dae4b0541f62c72cec\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-08T21:34:52.898Z\">9.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Iranian journalists in Geneva say there's a temporary break in trilateral Iran-EU-US talks but <strong>they are expected to resume this evening,</strong> the Guardian's Saeed Kamali Dehghan reports.&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SaeedKD/statuses/398924695723970560\"> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Journalists in Geneva InterContinental hotel are exhausted but desperate for any indication of what's happening in Zarif-Ashton-Kerry trilat</p>— Saeed Kamali Dehghan (@SaeedKD) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SaeedKD/statuses/398924695723970560\">November 8, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-527d5708e4b0541f62c72ceb\" class=\"block\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-08T21:28:37.985Z\">9.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> <div class=\"block-elements\"> <p>Guardian diplomatic correspondent Julian Borger (@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/julianborger\">julianborger</a>)&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/08/iran-nuclear-deal-q-and-a?CMP=twt_gu\">has published </a>a useful <strong>Q&amp;A guide to the Geneva negotiations</strong>.
